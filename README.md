# dahlia-router

Lending and borrowing router using Womrhole messaging protocol. 


This is a test application on top of Solana that uses cross-domain messaginging to find the lowest rates for borrowing and the highest yields for lending to whitelisted money market protocols on each supported chain. The intent is to allow tokens to natively move between a desired interest rate across multiple remote blockchains completely on-chain.
