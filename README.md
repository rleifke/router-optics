Lending and borrowing between n+ domains using Hyperlane messaging protocol. 


This is a test application on top of Celo and Ethereum that uses cross-domain messaginging to borrow on one chain and lend out on the other. The intent is to allow tokens to natively move between a desired interest rate across multiple remote blockchains completely on-chain.
